The alphabet contains both vowel and consonant letters (yes, we divide the letters).

Vowels -- *A E I O U Y*

Consonants -- *B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Z*

You are given a block of text with different words. 
These words are separated by white-spaces and punctuation marks.
Numbers are not considered words in this mission (a mix of letters and digits is not a word either).
You should count the number of words (striped words) where the vowels with consonants are alternating,
that is; words that you count cannot have two consecutive vowels or consonants.
The words consisting of a single letter are not striped -- do not count those. Casing is not significant for this mission.
